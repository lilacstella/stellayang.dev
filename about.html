                <p>Sixty-seven thousand users and counting. What I originally
                    envisioned
                    as just a casual summer Discord bot project for collecting
                    characters from shows in a trading card fashion, garnered
                    more
                    attention than what me and the team I led could ever
                    expected.
                    <br>
                    I love to build, to create, to make something my very own
                    from
                    nothing. I have loved the craft of engineering since the
                    times I
                    could pick up a wooden block. Throughout my experiences with
                    drag-and-drop programming as a child and more powerful
                    programming
                    languages like Java and Python, I have found that Computer
                    Science
                    is the most accessible way to construct projects in our
                    modern
                    world. Regardless of identity, status, or environment, an
                    internet
                    connection unlocks access to the world's most powerful
                    toolkit.
                    <br>
                    Now, I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science
                    at
                    Texas
                    A&M to advance my current mostly self-taught understanding
                    and
                    go on
                    to build bigger and better projects. Specifically within
                    Computer
                    Science, I am interested in Data Science and Cybersecurity.

                Highlight of Experiences: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Published a scientific peer-reviewed paper in the
                        journal
                        Solar Energy that detailed the transformation of the
                        solar
                        cell
                        material double perovskite to halve the costs of solar
                        panels
                        and entirely eliminate toxic byproduct production</li>
                    <li>Designed an AI model that predicts computational fluid
                        dynamic simulations set-up which would cut back
                        thousands of
                        dollars and hours for training. Research paper currently
                        under
                        review.</li>
                    <li>Assembled sample machine learning model and standardized
                        benchmarks at MSBAI that was responsible for a critical
                        part
                        of
                        developing the AI agent GURU. This service was later
                        selected
                        by the U.S. Air Force for the $1 million contract AFWERX
                        Small
                        Business Innovation Research Phase II Contract.</li>
                    <li>Conducted and cleanly compiled thorough, efficient, and
                        timely due diligence research at MicroVentures which
                        supported
                        many successful offerings on the platform such as Sila
                        Nanotechnologies which raised $655 thousand within 24
                        hours.</li>
